Currently, since I am able to capture the generics for the 4th source generator for dependency injection, I have to do the following:

for now, i am using the names to match.

If i ever have a case where I had to use a different name to mean the same thing for the processes, then will mean the following:

it will mean i have to capture the symbol name for the generic constraint.
and match on it.

for now, will attempt to do by names.
which means names has to be consistent.

if the names don't work, then will need the generic constraint.
